# Github Setup Guide
## Creating a GitHub Account
In order to use GitHub for the active learning portion of this activity (and for future projects!) you will need to make a personal GitHub account.
- [ ] Navigate to: https://github.com
- [ ] Click "sign up" in the top right corner and fill in the prompts for your email, password, and username.

## Installing Git
We will be interacting with GitHub via the Git CLI (Command Line Interface). This means that you must have Git installed on your personal machine.

- [ ] Download and install the latest version of Git: https://git-scm.com/downloads
- [ ] Set your user name in Git: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/setting-your-username-in-git
- [ ] Set your commit email in Git and GitHub: https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-email-preferences/setting-your-commit-email-address
